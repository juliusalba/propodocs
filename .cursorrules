# Project Rules (King Mode)

## Safety and Change Control
- Do NOT run destructive commands.
- Do NOT modify files outside this repo.
- Do NOT touch .env, credentials, keys, tokens.
- Prefer small diffs. Avoid sweeping refactors unless asked.
- When editing, preserve existing architecture unless asked to change it.

## Stack Discipline
- Use only the libraries already in this repo.
- If you need a new dependency, ask first and explain why.
- Never hallucinate packages or APIs.

## Output Discipline
- Default: output code/diff first, minimal commentary.
- If uncertain about installed libraries or project structure, stop and ask.

## Ultrathink Trigger
When the user includes "ultrathink":
- Analyze performance, scalability, state shape, failure modes.
- Reject naive solutions.
- Then implement.
